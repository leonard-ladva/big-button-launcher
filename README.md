## Idea & Purpose
This app was made during HackCodex 2023, a 48 hour hackaton in Riga. 
The inspiration came from Braille keyboard smartphone apps where the user holds their device with the screen facing away from them and has tactile/audio feedback for all actions. 
The idea is that the launcher sorts every action/app on your phone into one of three categories on each page.

## Interaction
- Tap to go into a category.
- Double tap anywhere to go back.
- Hold on a button to hear the category name.

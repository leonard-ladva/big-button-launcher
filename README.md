# Big Button Launcher
Android Launcher that simplifies smartphone usage for the blind or visually impaired.

## Idea & Purpose
This app was made during HackCodex 2023, a 48 hour hackaton in Riga. 
The inspiration came from Braille keyboard smartphone apps where the user holds their device with the screen facing away from them and has tactile/audio feedback for all actions.
